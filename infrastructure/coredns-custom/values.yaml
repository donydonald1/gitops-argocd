# Split-horizon DNS configuration
# This chart configures CoreDNS to rewrite external hostnames to internal services
# Enables Harbor S3 redirect by routing s3.ops.techsecom.io to internal HTTPS proxy

# DNS rewrites are configured in the Corefile template:
# - s3.ops.techsecom.io -> minio-https.minio.svc.cluster.local (HTTPS on 443)

# The minio-https service is created by the minio chart's internal-https-proxy.yaml
# It provides TLS termination and forwards to MinIO's HTTP port 9000
