# Split-horizon DNS configuration
# These entries allow internal cluster traffic to resolve to internal IPs
# while external traffic uses public DNS

splitHorizonDNS:
  # MinIO S3 endpoint - resolves to internal service for faster Harbor image pulls
  - host: s3.ops.techsecom.io
    ip: 10.43.126.156  # kubectl get svc -n minio minio -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'

  # Add more entries as needed:
  # - host: minio.ops.techsecom.io
